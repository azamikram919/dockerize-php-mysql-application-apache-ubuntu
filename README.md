# Dockerize php mysql application

Dockerized PHP Gym Web application, authentication, php, mysql, database, connectivity, apahce, ubuntu, docker

## How it Works
Docker builds an image containing the docker-compose.yml and all of its dependencies by using the Dockerfile contained in this repository.

The Dockerfile tells docker to use the [official PHP Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) as the parent image.

The Mysql image then uses the [MySql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) Docker image as its parent image.

At this point, an image has been built which contains Apache, PHP, Mysql, PDO Extensions and all of the OS dependencies and libraries required to serve a web application written in PHP.

Finally, docker copies everything in src/ inside this repository to the /var/www/html folder inside the image. This is the Apache web root directory.
